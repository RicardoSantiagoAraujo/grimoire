## Mythological creature compendium with combar mode

This is a dynamic mythological creature compendium sourced from a database, with added bonus of a simple game where creature can clash in combat in rock-paper-scissors style.

The web application is built with a Java Spring back-end that comgimunicates with a MySQL database with full CRUD implementation. The front-end is built with TypeScript using the Angular 2 framework.
